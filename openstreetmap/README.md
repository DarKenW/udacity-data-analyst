Data Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data
================================

In this project, we choose a area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org
and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for
validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the
OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that we care about.
